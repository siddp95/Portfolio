Siddarth Puliyanda Portfolio

Welcome to my personal Github portfolio! As a Data Science enthusiast with a focus on sports and online gaming, I have developed a range of programming projects that demonstrate my skills, knowledge, and passion in this field.

This portfolio contains three of my programming project highlights, showcasing my ability to collect, clean, analyze, and visualize data to extract insights and solve real-world problems.

Projects:

NBA MVP ML: in this project, I built a Machine Learning model that predicts who will win MVP in a given season and compares it to what the actual results is. There are 3 separate notebooks related to the research, which include scraping data from basketball-reference, cleaning up the data, and the finally building the model and analyzing the results.

2023 TD Regression: in this project, I collected and analyzed data from the 2022 NFL season to calculate whether or not a player scored more or less touchdowns than expected, and stated how this info might be useful to us for the 2023 NFL season.

Blackjack Simulation: in this project, I created a Monte Carlo simulation to test the effectiveness of different Blackjack strategies. The strategies include what value to stay on, how many decks the table should have, and the Martingale betting system.
