# Siddarth Puliyanda Portfolio

Welcome to my personal Github portfolio! 

As a Big Data professional, I leverage programming and analytics tools to transform raw data into actionable insights. This repository highlights my ability to tackle real-world problems through data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Each project demonstrates my technical skills, analytical thinking, and passion for extracting value from dataâ€”whether optimizing processes, uncovering trends, or driving decision-making. Feel free to explore my work to see how I can contribute to your team.  
Projects:

Blackjack Simulation: I created a Monte Carlo simulation to test the effectiveness of different Blackjack strategies. The strategies include what value to stay on, how many decks the table should have, and the Martingale betting system. An extensive write up is included that explains the mathematics and theory behind the study.

NBA MVP ML: I built a Machine Learning model that predicts who will win MVP in a given season and compares it to what the actual results is. There are 3 separate notebooks related to the research, which include scraping data from basketball-reference, cleaning up the data, and the finally building the model and analyzing the results.

2024 TD Regression: I collected and analyzed data from the 2023 NFL season to calculate whether or not a player scored more or less touchdowns than expected, and stated how this info might be useful to us for the 2024 NFL season. The results of the analysis is used in my fantasy football research and has led to great success in past years.
